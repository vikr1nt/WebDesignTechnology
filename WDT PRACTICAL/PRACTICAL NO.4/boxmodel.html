<h1>city of sheikh</h1>
<div class="vik1">Dubai[a] is the most populous city in the United Arab Emirates and the capital of the Emirate of Dubai, the most populated of the country's seven emirates.[5][6][7] As of 2024, the city has a population of around 3.79 million,[8] more than 90% of which are expatriates.[9]

    Beginning in the early 20th century, Dubai developed into a significant regional and international trade hub, emphasizing on tourism and luxury.[10] Dubai has been a center for regional
     and international trade since the early 20th century, and its economy relies on revenues from trade, tourism, aviation, real estate, and financial services.[11][12][13][14] Oil revenue
      helped accelerate the development of the city. However, oil production contributed less than 1 percent to the emirate's GDP in 2018.</div>
